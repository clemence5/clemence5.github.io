I'm an Astrophysics Masters student with a passion for problem solving. My interests include Machine Learning, and Data Science in general, supported by half a dozen years of using Python to solve academic and research problems.
I have recently built reliable competences in exploratory data analysis, model building and evaluation, data visualisation, markup languages and others using Anaconda and Jupyter, LaTeX, sklearn, Tableau public and Google products such as TensorFlow, collaboratory and so forth.
