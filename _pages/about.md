I'm an Astrophysics Masters student with a passion for problem solving. My interests include Machine Learning, and Data Science in general, supported by half a dozen years of using Python to solve academic and research problems.

My curiosity and passion for science and technology inspired my decision to obtain degrees in Physics, Astrophysics and Space Science from which I have gained strong analytical and problem-solving skills. My educational career has additionally endowed me with the mathematical, statistical and research skills necessary for thriving in the modern professional environment.
Furthermore, I also have built reliable competences in EDA (exploratory data analysis), model building and evaluation, data visualisation, markup languages and others using Anaconda and Jupyter, LaTeX, sklearn, Tableau public and Google products such as TensorFlow, collaboratory and so forth.

### 4IR
In addition to my tertiary and self-studying, my interest in machine learning and the broader data science and STEM fields has driven me to constantly stay abreast with recent 4IR developments.
I am also a big fan of open-source tools and one of my main motivations for this blog is to help upcoming ML enthusiasts like myself with accessible tips and easy to understand and repurpose tools for solving problems in business and beyond.

The list of the most important skills for 4IR-readiness chiefly comprises soft skills which are within reach for economically underprivileged demographics, and the improved connectivity of recent years has increasingly made access to the hard skills much cheaper and easier to access with a bit of research (Google, Youtube, affordable online courses, Kaggle, etc). I have personally had the privilege of exploiting a lot of these channels to avoid ‘re-inventing the wheel’ every time I have had to complete a task or learn a new skill to get to where I am now.

I believe having and sharpening these and other 4IR-conscious skills allows me to future-proof my career while positioning myself to contribute to the development of my community through skills-sharing and other means.
The (mostly open-source) tools I have been exposed to, thanks to the emergence and popularisation of the 4IR, have made my life, work and studies much less challenging, and are fun to work with!

### Giving back

In my free time, I have engaged in Science tutoring and outreach endeavours since 2012, partnering with the UWC physics department, the South African Astronomical Observatory (SAAO), the Children’s Radio Foundation (CRF), my former bursar (the HCI Foundation) among others. Lastly, I am a passionate communicator who enjoys public speaking, a skill that has been nurtured through conference presentations and public outreach events.

I would appreciate any opportunities to showcase my talents, and to learn about other exciting tools being used for quantitative analysis, data analysis and visualisation in a professional environment.

Feel free to contact me to chat about work-related prospects or provide comments or if you have any questions about the content on this site :)
