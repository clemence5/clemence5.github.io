# Classifying Red Wine with Machine Learning  

## Aim:
We want to predict the quality of red wine given the following attributes:
* fixed acidity
* volatile acidity
* citric acid
* residual sugar
* chlorides
* free sulfur dioxide
* total sulfur dioxide
* density
* pH
* sulphates
and
* alcohol

## Dataset:
The dataset, which is hosted and kindly provided free of charge by the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine), is of red wine from [Vinho Verde](http://www.vinhoverde.pt/en/about-vinho-verde) in Portugal


Basic text with *italicised* and **bold** text.

Equations are inserted using mathjax:
$$z = x+y$$


and we are using data from [This archive](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine)

We want to classify wine **quality** based on the following attributes:


To begin,
In a Jupyter notebook, We import and quickly view our dataset like so:
```python
import pandas as pd #along with other libraries (download the notebook to see)
dataset_url = 'http://mlr.cs.umass.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine-quality/winequality-red.csv'
data = pd.read_csv(dataset_url, sep=';')
data.head()
```
