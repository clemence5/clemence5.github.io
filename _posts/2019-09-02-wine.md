### H3 Heading

Basic text with *italicised* and **bold** text.

Equations are inserted using mathjax:
$$z = x+y$$

Our code is hosted on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/12Nx7W-RSRLgA0EZ9u4DPVc3HrtpN3luu#scrollTo=l8FXqvALSrm7&forceEdit=true&offline=true&sandboxMode=true)

and we are using data from [This archive](ttp://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine)

We want to classify wine **quality** based on the following attributes:
* fixed acidity
* volatile acidity
* citric acid
* residual sugar
* chlorides
* free sulfur dioxide
* total sulfur dioxide
* density
* pH
* sulphates
and
* alcohol

To begin,
In a Jupyter notebook, We import and quickly view our dataset like so:
```python
import pandas as pd #along with other libraries (download the notebook to see)
dataset_url = 'http://mlr.cs.umass.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine-quality/winequality-red.csv'
data = pd.read_csv(dataset_url, sep=';')
data.head()
```
